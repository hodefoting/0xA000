0xA000 is a pixel/tile/component based font generator, as well as a
font-family based on this. The tool itself is licensed under the ISC license;
while the font it ships with is licensed under OFL.

To see the generated fonts in action take a look at
http://pippin.gimp.org/0xA000/

Dependencies:
  glib
  gegl and babl
  font-forge with python bindings
  make

Just running "make" in the checkout of 0xA000 should generate all the fonts.

I consider the 0xA000 sources themselves to be a side-effect of the actual
font-design; and as such doesn't warrant very extensive documentation.
See index.html and Tech.html for more information about the fonts themselves
as well as how the format itself is used.
